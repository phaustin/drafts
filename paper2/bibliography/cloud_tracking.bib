  abstract = {The subtropical low cloud response to a climate with SST uniformly
	warmed by 2 K is analyzed in the SP- CAM superparameterized climate
	model, in which each grid column is replaced by a two-dimensional
	cloud-resolving model (CRM). Intriguingly, SP-CAM shows substantial
	low cloud increases over the subtropical oceans in the warmer climate.
	The paper aims to understand the mechanism for these increases. The
	subtropical low cloud increase is analyzed by sorting grid-column
	months of the climate model into composite cloud regimes using percentile
	ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS). LTS is observed to
	be well correlated to subtropical low cloud amount and boundary layer
	vertical structure. The low cloud increase in SP-CAM is attributed
	to boundary-layer destabilization due to increased clear-sky radiative
	cooling in the warmer climate. This drives more shallow cumulus convection
	and a moister boundary layer, inducing cloud increases and further
	increasing the radiative cooling. The boundary layer depth does not
	change substantially, due to compensation between increased radiative
	cooling (which promotes more turbulent mixing and boundary-layer
	deepening) and slight strengthening of the boundary-layer top inversion
	(which inhibits turbulent entrainment and promotes a shallower boundary
	layer). The widespread changes in low clouds do not appear to be
	driven by changes in mean subsidence.<br />In a companion paper we
	use column-mode CRM simulations based on LTS-composite profiles to
	further study the low cloud response mechanisms and to explore the
	sensitivity of low cloud response to grid resolution in SP-CAM.},
